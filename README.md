# New_Classification
For the sake of classifying reading content, the knowledge of Natural Language
Processing(NLP) is supposed to be involved in our project. NLP is a way for computers to
analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way.
It is also able to be applied to text classification, automatic summarization, translation,
sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and conversion.

In this project, using CNN and RNN algorithms to implement text classification
respectively. Both of them were a good demonstration of NLP implement. The dataset
comprises three different groups: training dataset, testing dataset, and validation dataset.
The training dataset is used to generate an appropriate model by CNN or RNN algorithms.
And the testing data will be tested by the model. Then we will compare each result with
validation data set to calculate precision rate. Therefore, we can easily draw a conclusion
that which algorithm will perform best. And it also present the result in a visualized
way. In addition, the development environment will include three main libraries,
Tensorflow, scikit-learn, and scipy.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. 
Learning CNN and RNN Algorithm and NLP. 
The NLP paper recommended:

Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality

### Install and Setup a Python Environment for Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Anaconda

1.Download and install Anaconda
In this step, we will download the Anaconda Python package for your platform.

Anaconda is a free and easy-to-use environment for scientific Python.


```
1. Visit the Anaconda homepage.
2. Click “Anaconda” from the menu and click “Download” to go to the download page.
```

2.Start and Update Anaconda

```
conda -V
python -V
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
```
3.Install Tensorflow with Conda in Anaconda environment 
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorflow

```
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow 
```
After finishing setting up, run versions.py to check everything setup is correct.
```
python versions.py
```
You should see output like:
```
Wangs-MacBook-Pro:News_Classification wangweihan$ python versions.py 
scipy: 0.19.1
numpy: 1.13.3
matplotlib: 2.1.0
pandas: 0.20.3
statsmodels: 0.8.0
sklearn: 0.19.1
tensorflow: 1.4.0
```
### Running the Tranning set
