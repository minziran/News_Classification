# New_Classification
For the sake of classifying reading content, the knowledge of Natural Language
Processing(NLP) is supposed to be involved in our project. NLP is a way for computers to
analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way.
It is also able to be applied to text classification, automatic summarization, translation,
sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and conversion.

In this project, I will use CNN and RNN algorithms to implement text classification
respectively. Both of them were a good demonstration of NLP implement. The dataset
comprises three different groups: training dataset, testing dataset, and validation dataset.
The training dataset is used to generate an appropriate model by CNN or RNN algorithms.
And the testing data will be tested by the model. Then we will compare each result with
validation data set to calculate precision rate. Therefore, we can easily draw a conclusion
that which algorithm will perform best. And I will also present the result in a visualized
way. In addition, the development environment will include three main libraries,
Tensorflow, scikit-learn, and scipy.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. 
Learning CNN and RNN Algorithm and NLP. 
The NLP paper recommended:

Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality 
http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf

Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch 
http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/collobert11a/collobert11a.pdf

Wikipedia-based Semantic Interpretation for Natural Language Processing
http://www.jair.org/media/2669/live-2669-4346-jair.pdf

Latent Dirichlet Allocation
http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

It will be added soon.

## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux) - The Deep learning used
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - A collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning(Matlab is good option too.) 
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) - A collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.
